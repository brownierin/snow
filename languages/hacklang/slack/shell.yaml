      At Slack, we try to avoid shelling out when possible. Sometimes, however, it's unavoidable.
      For these cases, we created lib_exec. Please use exec_ok and reach out to #triage-prodsec for a code review.

      If you can't avoid shelling out, please use exec_ok and
      ask for a code review in #triage-prodsec.
