#  pattern: strconv.Atoi(...)
#  fix: Replace use of strconv.Atoi() with strconv.ParseInt() or strconv.ParseUint() for bit sized unsigned integers.
#  message: |-
#    The size of int in Go is dependent on the system architecture.  The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems.  On a 64 bit system, if the value passed to the strconv.Atoi() function is bigger (or smaller if negative) than what can be stored in an int32, an integer overflow may occur.
