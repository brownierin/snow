  message: |
    Host key verification is disabled in the SSH library. This may permit an attacker to completely subvert encryption and gain access to encrypted contents, including passwords. A successful attacker will be able to inject commands into a terminal session, to modify data in transit, or to steal data.  To implement host key verification, use the 'golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/knownhosts' package.
