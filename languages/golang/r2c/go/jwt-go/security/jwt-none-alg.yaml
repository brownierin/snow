  message: |
    Detected use of the 'none' algorithm in a JWT token.
    The 'none' algorithm assumes the integrity of the token has already
    been verified. This would allow a malicious actor to forge a JWT
    without providing a valid signature. Do not explicitly use the 'none'
    algorithm.  Instead, utilize one of the jwt library's available signing algorithms, such as SigningMethodHS256.
