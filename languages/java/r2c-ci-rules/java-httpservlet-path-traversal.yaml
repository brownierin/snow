  message: |
    Detected a potential path traversal. A malicious actor
    could control the location of this file, to include going backwards
    in the directory with '../'. To address this, ensure that user-controlled
    variables in file paths are sanitized. You may also consider using a utility
    method such as org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...) to only
    retrieve the file name from the path. You may also consider validating that the 
    canonical path (returned by "getCanonicalPath") of the File object starts with 
    the intented directory.
